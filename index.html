        <p>
            HELLO GIANT panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo), also known as the panda bear or
            simply the panda, is a bear native to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Central_China">south central China</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The
            name
            <b>"giant panda"</b> is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.

        <p>                                                                                                 
            Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub">leaves </a>
            making up
            more than 99% of its diet.
        </p>
        <p> Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of
            birds,
            rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or
            bananas
            along with specially prepared food.
